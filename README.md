# EWU-Data-Structures
All programming projects completed by me in EWU's CSCD300 Course

## hw1_20
This was meant to be a review of linked lists, but for me it was pretty much learning linked lists for the first time. I knew what a linked list was, but I didn't know how to implement one, traverse one, inseritng and deleting nodes, none of that. What I did for this assignment was study linked lists like crazy and then I tested my knowledge with the project. This project was a great motivator for gaining proficiency in singly-linked lists.
## hw2_19
This project was about another linked list. This time instead of singly-linked, the complexity was raised to a circular doubly-linked list. While writing the code for this project I realized that even though these are much more complex, I enjoy working with these a lot more. They are way more efficient (with a lot of base functions being O(1) time) and the code can be much cleaner compared to the singly-linked list.
## hw3_19
Homework 3 emphasized recursion. Before this class, recursion was a scary ordeal for me because I didn't understand how to attack these problems well. My instructor for this class gave some great tips for tackling recursive problems. With these tips, I was able to recursivley reverse a linked list, as well as solve some common array manipulation problems with recursion. I even memorized the recursive array selection sort from this homework in order to take EWU's APE exam.
## hw4
Homework 4 was not a project. Instead I was given a few different pieces of code and asked to calculate the time complexity of each snippet.
## hw56, calculator
Homework 5 (or 6 depending on which homework the student wanted to do, I chose 5) had to do with infix and postfix expressions. This was very interesting to me becuase we implemented a linked stack in order to evaluate these mathematical expressions that were given to us. There was the option to hook the instructor's GUI calculator to our code but I was running low on time while completing this homework so I didn't do that. I have plans to implement the GUI over spring break when my current classes are over with.
## hw7_19
Homework 7 was a very short and simple demponstration of a hash table. All we had to do was implement one method. The method was to search for a key and return the value connected to that key. This required workarounds as our hashtable structure used separate chaining to store duplicate hashes.
## hw8
This was the last project assigned in this class. The goal of this project was to demonstrate a merge sort on a linked list. Code was proviede in the tester file, but the linked list and linked queue were written from scratch by myself. Something I found interesting about the merge sort algorithm I used was how it implements a queue, and each node in the queue stores a 1-element linked list. This was unlike anything I have seen previously in my programming career. As seen in the tester file, the merge sort's time-to-sort is cimpared against the insertion sort's time-to-sort.
